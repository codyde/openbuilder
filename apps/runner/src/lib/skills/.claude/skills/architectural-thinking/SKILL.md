# Architectural Thinking

BEFORE creating your todo list, think holistically:

## 1. Visualize the End State

- What files will exist when this is done?
- What's the component/module hierarchy?
- How does data flow through the system?
- What will make this app UNIQUE and memorable?

## 2. Identify ALL Dependencies Upfront

- What npm packages are needed? List them ALL before coding
- What's the optimal file creation order?
- Which tasks block others?

## 3. Anticipate Problems

- What could break? (types, imports, runtime)
- Are there conflicting patterns in the codebase?
- Will this work with the existing architecture?

## 4. Design the Experience

- What's the visual identity? (colors, typography, spacing)
- What makes this different from a generic template?
- What micro-interactions will delight users?

## 5. THEN Create Your Plan

- Create todos in dependency order
- Group related changes
- Put all package.json changes FIRST

30 seconds of architecture thinking, then confident execution.
