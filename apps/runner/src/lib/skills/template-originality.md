# Template Originality

The template is a SCAFFOLD, not a design to copy.

The downloaded template provides:
- Project structure and configuration
- Build tooling and dev server setup
- Framework boilerplate (routing, etc.)

You MUST:

## Replace Template Visuals Completely

- DELETE or completely rewrite the template's example components
- Do NOT keep template hero sections, cards, or layouts
- Do NOT reuse template color schemes or typography
- Create YOUR OWN visual identity from scratch

## Design for THIS Specific App

- What is the app's personality? (playful, serious, minimal, bold)
- What colors represent THIS brand?
- What layout serves THIS content?

## Traps to AVOID

- Keeping the template's "Welcome to [Framework]" hero
- Reusing template card layouts with just new text
- Using template's default purple/indigo color scheme
- Copying template navigation structure exactly
- Leaving template example pages like "About" or "Features"

## What to DO

- Wipe template components and write new ones
- Choose a UNIQUE color palette (not purple/blue/indigo)
- Design layouts specific to the requested features
- Create custom navigation for this app's needs
- Build components that serve the actual user request

Every app should look COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from the template it started from.
