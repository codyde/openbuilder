# Template Originality

The template is a scaffold -- it provides structure, build tooling, and routing. Its visual design is disposable.

## What to Replace

- Delete or completely rewrite template example components (hero sections, sample cards, "Welcome to X" pages)
- Replace the template's color scheme and typography with choices specific to this app
- Design layouts that serve this app's actual content, not the template's demo content

## How to Think About It

- What is this app's personality? (playful, serious, minimal, bold)
- What colors represent this specific brand or purpose?
- What layout structure serves these specific features?

## Example

Template ships with: purple gradient hero, 3-column feature cards, "About" and "Features" pages.

For a recipe app: Warm earth-tone palette, editorial food photography layout, ingredient-focused navigation, full-bleed recipe cards. Nothing from the template survives visually.

## Avoid

- Keeping template hero sections with just the text swapped
- Reusing the template's default color scheme (especially purple/indigo)
- Copying template navigation structure when the app needs something different
- Leaving template example pages like "About" or "Features" with placeholder content
